# Release Script Replacement Epic

## Epic Overview

Replace the current release script configuration with the one from the sudolang.ai project, copying their approach exactly to ensure consistent release processes.

## Context

- **Current State**: cuid2 project uses `release-it` with basic configuration in package.json
- **Target State**: Release script configuration matching sudolang.ai project exactly
- **Technology Stack**: Node.js, npm, release-it tool
- **Source**: sudolang.ai project repository

## Requirements Analysis

### Functional Requirements

- **Given** the need to standardize release processes, **should** copy sudolang.ai release configuration exactly
- **Given** the release script replacement, **should** maintain all current functionality
- **Given** the new configuration, **should** work with existing cuid2 project structure
- **Given** the release process, **should** handle version bumping, tagging, and publishing
- **Given** the configuration files, **should** include all necessary release-it settings

### Non-Functional Requirements

- **Compatibility**: Must work with existing cuid2 project setup
- **Reliability**: Should not break existing release workflow
- **Consistency**: Must match sudolang.ai configuration exactly
- **Maintainability**: Should be easy to understand and modify if needed

## Success Criteria

- [ ] sudolang.ai release configuration examined and understood
- [ ] Current cuid2 release configuration documented
- [ ] sudolang.ai release script/configuration copied exactly
- [ ] New configuration tested and validated
- [ ] Release process works without breaking existing functionality
- [ ] All release-it settings properly configured

## Dependencies

- Access to sudolang.ai repository
- Understanding of current cuid2 release process
- release-it tool compatibility

## Estimated Effort

**Small** - Primarily configuration file updates and validation

## Agent Orchestration

**Not Required** - Standard configuration replacement task

## Implementation Notes

- Must copy sudolang.ai release configuration exactly as requested
- Preserve existing cuid2 project structure and dependencies
- Test release process after replacement to ensure functionality
- Document any differences between old and new configuration

## Task Breakdown

### Task 1: Examine sudolang.ai Release Configuration

**Context**: Understanding the source configuration to copy
**Requirements**:

- Given the need to copy sudolang.ai configuration, should examine their release setup
- Given the repository access, should identify all release-related files
- Given the configuration files, should understand their structure and settings
  **Success Criteria**:
- [ ] sudolang.ai repository located and accessed
- [ ] Release configuration files identified (package.json scripts, .release-it.json, etc.)
- [ ] Configuration structure documented
- [ ] All release-related settings catalogued
      **Dependencies**: None
      **Estimated Effort**: Small

### Task 2: Document Current cuid2 Configuration

**Context**: Understanding current release setup before replacement
**Requirements**:

- Given the need to preserve functionality, should document current configuration
- Given the existing setup, should identify all release-related settings
  **Success Criteria**:
- [ ] Current package.json release script documented
- [ ] Any existing release-it configuration files identified
- [ ] Current release process workflow understood
      **Dependencies**: None
      **Estimated Effort**: Small

### Task 3: Replace Release Configuration

**Context**: Implementing the sudolang.ai configuration in cuid2
**Requirements**:

- Given the sudolang.ai configuration, should copy it exactly to cuid2
- Given the replacement, should maintain project compatibility
- Given the new configuration, should ensure all settings are properly applied
  **Success Criteria**:
- [ ] sudolang.ai release configuration copied exactly
- [ ] package.json scripts updated
- [ ] Any additional configuration files added
- [ ] Configuration matches sudolang.ai exactly
      **Dependencies**: Task 1 (Examine sudolang.ai), Task 2 (Document Current)
      **Estimated Effort**: Small

### Task 4: Validate and Test Configuration

**Context**: Ensuring the new configuration works properly
**Requirements**:

- Given the new configuration, should test release process
- Given the validation, should ensure no functionality is broken
- Given the testing, should verify all release steps work correctly
  **Success Criteria**:
- [ ] Release configuration validated
- [ ] Release process tested (dry run)
- [ ] No breaking changes identified
- [ ] All release steps functional
      **Dependencies**: Task 3 (Replace Configuration)
      **Estimated Effort**: Small

## Risk Assessment

- **Low Risk**: Configuration file updates with existing tooling
- **Mitigation**: Test release process before actual release
- **Contingency**: Revert to original configuration if issues arise

## Acceptance Criteria

The epic is complete when:

1. sudolang.ai release configuration has been examined and understood
2. Current cuid2 configuration has been documented
3. sudolang.ai configuration has been copied exactly to cuid2
4. New configuration has been tested and validated
5. Release process works without breaking existing functionality
6. All release-it settings are properly configured

## Notes

- Must copy sudolang.ai configuration "to the letter" as requested
- Focus on exact replication rather than adaptation
- Ensure compatibility with existing cuid2 project structure
