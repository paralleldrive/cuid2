 ### Performance
 
 Id generation should be fast enough that humans won't notice a delay, but too slow to feasibly brute force (even in parallel).

 #### Tiny
 
 Page loads need to be FAST, and that means we can't waste a lot of JavaScript on a complex algorithm. Cuid2 is tiny. This is especially important for thick-client JavaScript applications.
 
-
 ### Secure
 
 Client-visible ids often need to have sufficient random data and entropy to make it practically impossible to try to guess valid IDs based on an existing, known id. That makes simple sequential ids unusable in the context of client-side generated database keys. Additionally, using V4 UUIDs is also not safe, because there are known attacks on several id generating algorithms that a sophisticated attacker can use to predict next ids. Cuid2 has been audited by security experts and artificial intelligence, and is considered safe to use for use-cases like secret sharing links.
 
-
 ### Portable
 
 Most stronger forms of the UUID / GUID algorithms require access to OS services that are not available in browsers, meaning that they are impossible to implement as specified. Further, our id standard needs to be portable to many languages (the original cuid has 22 different language implementations).

 In Cuid2, we use a tiny, fast, security-audited, NIST-standardized hash function and we seed it with random entropy, so on production environments where the globals are all identical, we lose the unique fingerprint, but still get random entropy to replace it, strengthening collision resistance.
 
-
 ### Deterministic Length
 
 Length was non-deterministic in Cuid. This worked fine in almost all cases, but proved to be problematic for some data structure uses, forcing some users to create wrapper code to pad the output. We recommend sticking to the defaults for most cases, but if you don't need strong uniqueness guarantees, (e.g., your use-case is something like username or URL disambiguation), it can be fine to use a shorter version.
 
-
 ### More Efficient Session Counter Entropy
 
 The original Cuid wasted entropy on session counters that were not always used, rarely filled, and sometimes rolled over, meaning they could collide with each other if you generate enough ids in a tight loop, reducing their effectiveness. Cuid2 initializes the counter with a random number so the entropy is never wasted. It also uses the full precision of the native JS number type. If you only generate a single id, the counter just extends the random entropy, rather than wasting digits, providing even stronger anti-collision protection.
 
-
 ### Parameterized Length
 
 Different use-cases have different needs for entropy resistance. Sometimes, a short disambiguating series of random digits is enough: for example, it's common to use short slugs to disambiguate similar names, e.g. usernames or URL slugs. Since the original cuid did not hash its output, we had to make some seriously limiting entropy decisions to produce a short slug. In the new version, all sources of entropy are mixed with the hash function, and you can safely grab a substring of any length shorter than 32 digits. You can roughly estimate how many ids you can generate before reaching 50% chance of collision with: [`sqrt(36^(n-1)*26)`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birthday_problem#Square_approximation), so if you use `4` digits, you'll reach 50% chance of collision after generating only `~1101` ids. That might be fine for username disambiguation. Are there more than 1k people who want to share the same username?

-
 ### Enhanced Security
 
 The original Cuid leaked details about the id, including very limited data from the host environment (via the host fingerprint), and the exact time that the id was created. The new Cuid2 hashes all sources of entropy into a random-looking string.
 
 Due to the hashing algorithm, it should not be practically possible to recover any of the entropy sources from the generated ids. Cuid used roughly monotonically increasing ids for database performance reasons. Some people abused them to select data by creation date. If you want to be able to sort items by creation date, we recommend making a separate, indexed `createdAt` field in your database instead of using monotonic ids because:
 
-* It's easy to trick a client system to generate ids in the past or future.
-* Order is not guaranteed across multiple hosts generating ids at nearly the same time.
-* Deterministically monotic resolution was never guaranteed.
+- It's easy to trick a client system to generate ids in the past or future.
+- Order is not guaranteed across multiple hosts generating ids at nearly the same time.
+- Deterministically monotic resolution was never guaranteed.
 
 In Cuid2, the hashing algorithm uses a salt. The salt is a random string which is added to the input entropy sources before the hashing function is applied. This makes it much more difficult for an attacker to guess valid ids, as the salt changes with each id, meaning the attacker is unable to use any existing ids as a basis for guessing others.

 ## Comparisons
 
 Security was the primary motivation for creating Cuid2. Our ids should be default-secure for the same reason we use https instead of http. The problem is, all our current id specifications are based on decades-old standards that were never designed with security in mind, optimizing for database performance charactaristics which are no longer relevant in modern, distributed applications. Almost all of the popular ids today optimize for being k-sortable, which was important 10 years ago. Here's what k-sortable means, and why it's no longer as important is it was when we created the Cuid specification which [helped inspire current standards like UUID v6 - v8](https://www.ietf.org/archive/id/draft-ietf-uuidrev-rfc4122bis-00.html#section-11.2):

+TL;DR: Stop worrying about k-sortable ids. They're not a big deal anymore. Use `createdAt` fields instead.
 
-**The performance impact of using sequential keys in modern systems is often exaggerated.** If your database is too small to use cloud-native solutions, it's also too small to worry about the performance impact of sequential vs random ids unless you're living in the distant past (i.e. you're using hardware from 2010). If it's large enough to worry, random ids may still be faster.
+In the past, sequential keys could potentially have a significant impact on performance, leading to the advice that you should use k-sortable ids—but this is no longer the case in modern systems. If your database is too small to use cloud-native solutions, it's also too small to worry about the performance impact of sequential vs random ids unless you're living in the distant past (i.e. you're using hardware from 2010). If it's large enough to worry, random ids generally outperform k-sortable ids due to hotspots which hurt load-balancing across hosts.
 
-In the past, sequential keys could potentially have a significant impact on performance, but this is no longer the case in modern systems.
+One reason for using sequential keys is to avoid id fragmentation, which can require a large amount of disk space for databases with billions of records. However, at scales large enough for k-sortable ids to make a noticeable difference, modern systems usually use cloud-native databases that are designed to handle terabytes of data efficiently and at a low cost. Additionally, the entire database may be stored in memory or high-performance SSDs, providing fast random-access lookup performance. Therefore, the impact of fragmented keys on query performance is minimal.

This can cause a significant performance impact.

+Sortable ids are generally SLOWER than random ids in distributed systems because they always append monotonically, creating index cluster-oriented [hotspots](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/stable/understand-hotspots) — writes clustered to the tail end of the index. Likewise, [Google Cloud Datastore recommends against sequential ids](https://cloud.google.com/datastore/docs/best-practices) for the same reason.
 
-So what kinds of operations suffer from a non-sequential id? Paged, sorted operations. Stuff like "fetch me 100000 records, sorted by id". That would be noticeably impacted, but how often do you need to sort by id if your id is opaque? I have never needed to. Modern cloud databases allow you to create indexes on `createdAt` fields which perform extremely well.
+Since all the writes are clustered in one place, it reduces the benefits of distributed load balancing, meaning that you get serial performance when you could have parallel performance. In other words, the system is forced to handle one write at a time instead of multiple writes in parallel.
 
-The worst part of K-Sortable ids is their impact on security. K-Sortable = insecure.
+It takes tens or hundreds of millions of rows for sequential/random id differences to be consequential, and once you get to that kind of scale, distributed load balancing is orders of magnitude more important for performance than your choice of id on any one host - the network becomes the bottleneck, and random ids become more beneficial for performance than k-sortable ids, because it helps load balancing systems avoid hotspot bottlenecks.

+description: When you need to make network requests or invoke side-effects, use this guide for saga pattern implementation
+alwaysApply: false
+---
+# JavaScript IO Guide
+
+Act as a top-tier software engineer with serious JavaScript/TypeScript discipline to isolate network I/O and effects using the saga pattern.
+
+The saga pattern consists of two main functions:
+
+- `call`
+- `put`
+
+## call(fn, ...args) => { CALL: { fn, args } }
+
+The `call` function takes a function and arguments and returns an object with those references as props. Use it to make network requests or invoke other side effects.
+
+The saga itself never calls the effect function. Instead, it yields the effect object. This allows the saga to behave deterministically with no side-effects, allowing you to test and debug the saga without running the side effects. You can then pass any result or error back into the saga to test various branches of the saga without mocking the integrated components.
+
+## put(action) => { PUT: Action }
+
+The `put` function is used to dispatch an action to the store. Use it to update tha state.
+
+
+## Action
+
+An action is an object with a `type` property and a `payload` property. It's used in central dispatch architectures such as Redux to update the state in a way that provides obvservability into semantic user intents, a complete log of user actions, along with the specific components (slices) that originated the action.
+
+
+## Saga Runtime
+
+Saga driver runtime runs the sagas, handles side effects, passes data back into the saga, and dispatches `put` actions to the store.
+
+## Testing sagas
+
+To test sagas, you can drive the saga by calling `iterator.next(optionalValue)`.
+
+e.g.
+
+```javascript
+describe("signInSaga happy path", async assert => {
+  const gen = signInUser();
+  
+  assert({
+    given: "load user triggered",
+    should: "call fetchUser with id",
+    actual: gen.next().value,
+    expected: call(fetchUser, "42")
+  });
+  
+  const fakeUser = { id: "42", name: "Pup" };
+  
+  assert({
+    given: "second yield",
+    should: "put the user data into the store",
+    actual: gen.next(fakeUser).value,
+    expected: put(userLoaded(fakeUser))
+  });
+  
+  assert({
+    given: "completion",
+    should: "be done",
+    actual: gen.next().done,
+    expected: true
+  });
+});

+
+## Before Writing Code
+
+- Read the lint and formatting rules.
+- Observe the project's relevant existing code.
+- Conform to existing code style, patterns, and conventions unless directed otherwise. Note: these instructions count as "directed otherwise" unless the user explicitly overrides them.
+
+Constraints {
+  Be concise.
+  Favor functional programming; keep functions short, pure, and composable.
+  Favor map, filter, reduce over manual loops.
+  Prefer immutability; use const, spread, and rest operators instead of mutation.
+  One job per function; separate mapping from IO.
+  Obey the projects lint and formatting rules.
+  Omit needless code and variables; prefer composition with partial application and point-free style.
+  Chain operations rather than introducing intermediate variables, e.g. `[x].filter(p).map(f)`
+  Avoid loose procedural sequences; compose clear pipelines instead.
+  Avoid `class` and `extends` as much as possible. Prefer composition of functions and data structures over inheritance.
+  Keep related code together; group by feature, not by technical type.
+  Put statements and expressions in positive form.
+  Use parallel code for parallel concepts. 
+  Avoid null/undefined arguments; use options objects instead.
+  Use concise syntax: arrow functions, object destructuring, array destructuring, template literals.
+  Avoid verbose property assignments. bad: `const a = obj.a;` good: `const { a } = obj;`
+  Assign reasonable defaults directly in function signatures.
+    `const createExpectedUser = ({ id = createId(), name = '', description = '' } = {}) => ({ id, name, description });`
+  Principle: Function callers should be able to understand the expected call signature by reading the function signature. This means:
+  Parameter values should be explicitly named and expressed in function signatures:
+    Bad: `const createUser = (payload = {}) => ({`
+    Good: `const createUser = ({ id = createId(), name = '', description = ''} = {}) =>`
+    Notice how default values also provide hints for type inference.
+  Avoid using || for defaults. Use parameter defaults instead. See above.
+  Prefer async/await or asyncPipe over raw promise chains.
+  Use strict equality (===).
+  Modularize by feature; one concern per file or function; prefer named exports.
+}
+
+NamingConstraints {
+  Use active voice.
+  Use clear, consistent naming.
+  Functions should be verbs. e.g. `increment()`, `filter()`.
+  Predicates and booleans should read like yes/no questions. e.g. `isActive`, `hasPermission`.
+  Prefer standalone verbs over noun.method. e.g. `createUser()` not `User.create()`.
+  Avoid noun-heavy and redundant names. e.g. `filter(fn, array)` not `matchingItemsFromArray(fn, array)`.
+  Avoid "doSomething" style. e.g. `notify()` not `Notifier.doNotification()`.
+  Lifecycle methods: prefer `beforeX` / `afterX` over `willX` / `didX`. e.g. `beforeUpdate()`.
+  Use strong negatives over weak ones: `isEmpty(thing)` not `!isDefined(thing)`.
+  Mixins and function decorators use `with${Thing}`. e.g. `withUser`, `withFeatures`, `withAuth`.
+  Avoid ALL_CAPS for constants. Since we use functional programming, there's no need for a hard distinction between constants and variables.

+---
+# Task Creator Metaprogram
+
+Act as a top-tier software project manager and systematic task planner and execution coordinator. Your job is to break down complex requests into manageable, sequential tasks that can be executed one at a time with user approval.
+
+A task can be broken down into smaller tasks. The larger task is stored in a task file in the $projectRoot/tasks folder. Subtasks live in that file.
+
+## Context Gathering
+
+Before beginning any task, gather/infer context. When in doubt, ask clarifying questions:
+
+TaskStatus = pending | inProgress | completed | blocked | cancelled
+
+State {
+  TaskName // The specific task being planned
+  Status // Current execution state
+  CodeContext // All relevant files, functions, and components that need to be examined or modified
+  StyleGuides // Coding standards, patterns, and conventions that apply to this work
+  Dependencies // External libraries, APIs, or system integrations required
+  Constraints // Technical limitations, performance requirements, or business rules
+  SuccessCriteria // Clear, measurable outcomes for the completed work
+  AgentRequirements // Assessment if task requires specialized agent expertise
+}
+
+
+## Requirements Analysis
+
+Use @requirements.mdc to analyze and generate the requirements of the task.
+
+## Agent Orchestration
+
+For complex tasks that require specialized expertise, systematically employ the agent orchestrator pattern in @agent-orchestrator.mdc
+  
+assessComplexity() {
+  criteria:
+    Multiple technical domains (UI, backend, testing, etc.)
+    Specialized knowledge (Redux, TDD, product management, etc.)
+    Cross-functional coordination
+    Integration with existing agent workflows
+}
+
+## Task Planning
+
+planTask() {
+  1. Decompose - Break the user's request into atomic, sequential tasks
+  2. Assess Agent Needs - For each task, determine if agent orchestration is required
+  3. Order tasks by dependencies and logical flow
+  4. Validate Ensure each task is specific, actionable, independently testable, small enough to complete in one focused session, clear about inputs, outputs, and success criteria
+  5. Sequence - Arrange tasks so each builds on the previous one
+  6. Checkpoint Plan approval gates between major phases
+}

+## Task Execution Protocol
+
+createPlan() {
+  1. Think = "🎯 restate |>💡 ideate |> 🪞 reflectCritically |> 🔭 expandOrthogonally |> ⚖️ scoreRankEvaluate |> 💬 respond"
+  2. Gather any additional context or clarification needed
+  3. Present the task/epic plan to the user for approval
+  4. Add the plan to the project root .plan.md file, with a reference to the epic plan file
+}
+
+executePlan() {
+  1. Complete only the current task
+  2. Validate - Verify the task meets its success criteria
+  3. Report - Summarize what was accomplished
+  4. Await Approval - Get explicit user approval before proceeding to the next task
+}
+
+## Task Plan Template Structure
+
+Each task should include:
+
+"""
+## [Task] $taskName
+
+$taskDescription
+
+**Context**: What files, patterns, or systems this task affects
+**Requirements**: 
+- Given [situation], should [jobToDo]

+**Success Criteria**:

+- [ ] Specific, measurable outcome 2
+
+**Dependencies**: What must be completed before this task
+**Estimated Effort**: [Small/Medium/Large] on exponential scale
+
+**Agent Orchestration**: [Required/Not Required]
+- If Required: Specify which agent(s) and why
+- Agent dispatch command if applicable
+
+**Implementation Notes**:
+- Key technical considerations
+- Potential challenges or risks
+- Suggested approach or patterns to follow
+- Agent-specific guidance if applicable
+"""
+
+## Completed Epic Documentation
+
+When an epic is completed, move it to tasks/archive/YYYY-MM-DD-${epicName}.md and update plan.md with:

+
+  **Status**: ✅ COMPLETED (${completionDate})

+  """
+}
+
+Constraints {
+  Never attempt multiple tasks simultaneously
+  Always get explicit user approval before moving to the next task
+  If a task reveals new information that changes the plan, pause and re-plan
+  Each task should be completable in ~50 lines of code or less
+  Tasks should be independent - completing one shouldn't break others
+  Always validate task completion before proceeding
+  If blocked or uncertain, ask clarifying questions rather than making assumptions
+  For complex tasks requiring agent orchestration, ensure proper agent dispatch before execution

+## assert
+
+type assert = ({ given: string, should: string, actual: any, expected: any }) {
+  `given` and `should` must clearly state the functional requirements from an acceptance perspective, and should avoid describing literal values.
+  Tests must demonstrate locality: The test should not rely on external state or other tests.
+
+  Ensure that the test answers these 5 questions {
+    1. What is the unit under test? (test should be in a named describe block)
+    2. What is the expected behavior? ($given and $should arguments are adequate)
+    3. What is the actual output? (the unit under test was exercised by the test)
+    4. What is the expected output? ($expected and/or $should are adequate)
+    5. How can we find the bug? (implicitly answered if the above questions are answered correctly)
+  }
+
+  Tests must be:
+  - Readable - Answer the 5 questions.
+  - Isolated/Integrated
+    - Units under test should be isolated from each other
+    - Tests should be isolated from each other with no shared mutable state.
+    - For integration tests, test integration with the real system.
+  - Thorough - Test expected/very likely edge cases
+  - Explicit - Everything you need to know to understand the test should be part of the test itself. If you need to produce the same data structure many times for many test cases, create a factory function and invoke it from the individual tests, rather than sharing mutable fixtures between tests.
+}
+
+
+## Process
+
+For each unit of code, create a test suite, one requirement at a time:
+
+1. If the user has not specified a test framework or technology stack, ask them before implementing.
+1. If the calling API is unspecified, propose a calling API that serves the functional requirements and creates an optimal developer experience.
+1. Write a test. Run the test runner and watch the test fail.
+1. Implement the code to make the test pass. Implement ONLY the code needed to make the test pass.
+1. Run the test runner: fail => fix bug; pass => continue
+1. Get approval from the user before moving on.
+1. Repeat the TDD iteration process for the next functional requirement.
+
+## Describe/Test Wrappers
+
+In most testing frameworks, there is a `describe` function and possibly a nested `test` or `it` wrapper.
+
+Use the string in the `describe` function to name the unit under test.
+
+Use the string in the `test` function to offer a brief category for the test, e.g. "new account creation".
+
+Because of conflicts with the `assert` function API and description, avoid the `it` wrapper entirely, if possible.
+
+
+Constraints {
+  Carefully think through correct output.
+  Avoid hallucination.
+  This is very important to ensure software works as expected and that user safety is protected. Please do your best work.
+  When testing app state logic, always use selectors to read from the state. NEVER read directly from state objects.
+  Avoid writing tests for expected types/shapes. It would be redundant with type checks.

+# Context7 GitHub Action Integration Epic
+
+## Epic Overview
+
+Integrate the Upsert Context7 GitHub Action into this repository to automatically maintain up-to-date code documentation for LLMs and AI code editors, with automatic updates triggered after successful release script runs.
+
+## Context
+
+- **Current State**: Repository with custom release script (`release.js`)
+- **Target State**: Repository with Context7 GitHub Action for automatic documentation updates
+- **Technology Stack**: Node.js, GitHub Actions, release-it workflow
+- **Integration Point**: Post-release automation workflow
+
+## Requirements Analysis
+
+### Functional Requirements
+
+- **Given** a successful release has completed, **should** trigger Context7 documentation update

+# Release Script Replacement Epic
+
+## Goal
+
+Extract sudolang.ai's release scripts into a shared npm package (`@paralleldrive/release-system`) that both sudolang.ai and cuid2 can import, eliminating duplication.
+
+## Current State
+
+Both projects have duplicate release scripts:
+
+- `release.js` - Main release script with validation and release-it integration
+- `lib/release-helpers.js` - Helper functions (sudolang.ai only)
+- `lib/update-latest-tag-hook.js` - Latest tag updater (sudolang.ai only)
+- `.release-it.json` - release-it configuration
+
+## Tasks
+
+### 1. Create & Package Release System
+
+- [ ] Create new repo: `@paralleldrive/release-system`
+- [ ] Extract scripts from sudolang.ai
+- [ ] Configure as npm package with bin exports
+- [ ] Test locally with yalc
+- [ ] Publish to npm
+
+### 2. Integrate into Projects
+
+- [ ] Install package in sudolang.ai
+- [ ] Install package in cuid2
+- [ ] Update package.json scripts in both
+- [ ] Remove local release files
+- [ ] Test release process (dry run) in both
+
+### 3. Validate
+
+- [ ] Verify release process works in both projects
+- [ ] Verify latest tag update functionality
+- [ ] Document usage for future projects
